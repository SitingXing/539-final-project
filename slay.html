                    Slay the Spire features a diverse set of bosses and enemies that become progressively more challenging as players progress through the game. Enemies range from basic melee and ranged attackers to more unique foes like thieves and birds. Bosses are much more powerful and require careful planning and strategy to defeat, often featuring unique abilities that can turn the tide of the battle. Players must carefully build their decks and make strategic decisions to overcome these challenging obstacles and progress through the game.
