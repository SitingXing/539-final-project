                    Rogue is a classic dungeon-crawling game first released in 1980. It features procedurally generated levels, turn-based gameplay, and permadeath, meaning that when the player's character dies, they must start over from the beginning. The game has inspired numerous other games with similar gameplay and mechanics, which are often referred to as "roguelike" games.

                    One of the most influential roguelike games was Nethack, which was first released in 1987. Nethack expanded on the gameplay mechanics of Rogue, adding new features like skill trees and a variety of different character classes. In the 1990s, roguelike games continued to evolve, with titles like Angband, ADOM, and Ancient Domains of Mystery introducing new gameplay elements and features. These games helped to establish many of the conventions that are now considered hallmarks of the roguelike genre, including procedurally generated levels, permadeath, and deep character customization options.
